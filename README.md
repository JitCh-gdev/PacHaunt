PacHaunt

Project Overview
PacHaunt is a horror themed 3D maze escape game inspired by Pac-Man where you must run from a dangerous Pac-Man. He moves randomly when you're not around, chases you when you're in sight, and moves to random locations when unseen. You can hide in wooden cabinets to avoid him. The goal is to find the exit and escape before you get caught.


Features:
 Smart Enemy AI:  Pac-Man hunts you down but also moves randomly.

 Hiding System:  Hide in wooden cabinets to stay safe.

 Minimap : Helps you navigate the maze.

 Creepy Atmosphere : Dark maze with eerie sounds.

Download Instructions
 GitHub Repository
You can clone the project from GitHub:
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/JitCh-gdev/PacHaunt

However, since I uploaded all files using Git LFS, some packages (like Terrain Painter and some UI) might not work correctly when cloning due to Git LFS quota limitations.

üìÅ Unity Packages (Recommended Fix)
To avoid missing files, I‚Äôve uploaded all Unity packages separately to Google Drive.
üëâ https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RYaHqLxwk1ndl3ZGtcNs-s9NmLHvNypD?usp=sharing

I recommend downloading all the packages, but if you want the most important one, grab MainLevel.unitypackage to ensure the core level loads correctly.

üéÆ Fully Built Version
If you just want to play the game without any setup, download the pre-built version from Itch.io:
